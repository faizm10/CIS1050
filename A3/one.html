                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey there! My name is Faiz Mustansar, and I am currently a first-year student studying Computer
                    Science at the University of Guelph. Before we delve into anything else, let's explore my
                    background!
                </p>
                <p>I was born and raised primarily in Scarborough, Ontario, however I did spend a short amount of time living in the United States before returning to Canada. People frequently ask me, "Are you an international student?" because of my accent.
                    I would say I am Canadian-Pakistani-Bangladesh as I was born in Canada and my mom was born in Pakistan and my dad was born in Bangladesh but moved to Pakistan because of the war at that time, so sometimes it irritates me and other times I don't mind when they ask me that.
                    I appear like I may be from Egypt, Pakistan, England, or somewhere else, according to others althought I find it quite hilarious when listening to them.

                </p>

                <p>
                    While I am not studying, I tend to watch sports and play sports such as soccer, basketball, badminton and you name it! I would say that I am a multi-sport athlete
                    as I tend to be above average for most of the sports. During summer, I would be at a local park playing soccer with friends or even with random groups every single day. I also play basketball, badminton and ping pong occasionally when I have someone whom I can play with.

                <h2>High School</h2>
                <img src="images/hb.jpeg" alt="Harold M. Brathwaite Secondary School" class="school-image">
                <p>
                    I attended Harold M. Brathwaite Secondary School, located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. I took the
                    local transit for forty minutes every day to and from school for four years. For a number of
                    reasons, I selected HB over Fletcher's Meadow Secondary School. My main goal was to start again,
                    make new acquaintances, and go on a new chapter in my academic career. Since middle school wasn't
                    the best part of my life and 90% of my friends were attending Fletcher's Meadow, I made the decision
                    to try other schools instead of taking a chance. Luckily, I was accepted to HB, where I succeeded
                    academically across multiple areas.
                </p>
                <p>Throughout my high school years, I engaged in ariety of extracurricular activities that have
                    developed
                    my leadership and teamwork skills.</p>
                <h3>Activities and Societies:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Varsity Badminton Team - Lost in Semi-Finals of the Qualifiers</li>
                    <li>Varsity Soccer Team - Won ROPSAA in Grade 11 but we lost in quarter-finals in Grade 12</li>
                    <li>HB MSA (Harold M Brathwaite Muslim Student Association) - Attended Events</li>
                    <li>Counting on You (COY) Tutoring Program - Mentored Grade 9 and 10 Students</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>
                    <h3>Grades 11-12 Highlights:</h3>
                </strong>
                <p>During my junior and senior years, I was part of the varsity soccer team where we won ROPSAA and
                    led various initiatives through the MSA, fostering a sense of community and belonging among
                    students. Additionally, I mentored younger students in math and science through the COY program,
                    which reinforced my passion for education and collaboration.</p>
                <h3>Grade 12 Breakdown</h3>
                <p>
                    I took advanced functions in the summer before I started grade 12 in order to reduce down on the
                    amount of math classes I had to take throughout the school year. I was happy with the final grade I
                    received of 85. Let's fast-forward to Grade 12 Semester 1, when I had Computer Engineering
                    Technology (TEJ4M0), Computer Science (ICS4U0), and International Business (BBB4M0). 
                    I had an average around mid 80s which was not enough for my university applications so I had to go all in 
                    for second semester if I wanted a chance. 
                    English, Personal Life Management, and College Law were required courses I had to take in the second
                    semester because I was not allowed to have two spares. I felt that this was a more pathetic
                    requirement. However, this semester I achieved high 90s in all of my subjects and that brought my average upto
                    90.5 which was a competitive average. I ended up getting offers from Wilfrid Laurier, Ontario Tech University, 
                    Guelph, Trent University and York University and I proudly accepted Guelph Computer Science offer!
                    Around midterm in 2nd semester, I skipped a lot of classes this semester because I wanted to visit and explore other locations for
                    pleasure. Traveling on GO buses is something I enjoy doing because it allows me to unwind and
                    reflect on life while I'm discovering new places, going to malls, and enjoying food. This semester
                    was incredibly boring, but looking back, I wish I had done some side projects to help me move ahead
                    of the incoming first-year students. Moving forward, I am making sure that I am creating time for
                    side projects so I can succeed outside of my studies.
