                <p>
                    Hey there! My name is Faiz Mustansar, and I am currently a first-year student studying Computer
                    Science at the University of Guelph. Before we delve into anything else, let's explore my
                    background!
                </p>

                <h2>High School</h2>
                <img src="images/hb.jpeg" alt="Harold M. Brathwaite Secondary School" class="school-image">
                <p>
                    I attended Harold M. Brathwaite Secondary School, located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. For four
                    years, I commuted for 40 minutes by local transit to and from school every day. I chose HB over
                    Fletcher's Meadow Secondary School for several reasons. My main reason was my desire to start my
                    life anew, to build new friendships, and to begin a fresh school life. Middle school wasn't the most
                    enjoyable time for me, and knowing that 90% of my peers would be going to Fletcher's Meadow, I
                    decided to take a chance on other schools. Fortunately, I was accepted at HB, where I achieved many
                    academic accomplishments.
                </p>
                <p>Throughout my high school years, I engaged in a rich variety of extracurricular activities that honed
                    my leadership and teamwork skills.</p>

                    <h3>Grades 11-12 Highlights:</h3>
                </strong>
                <p>During my junior and senior years, I was part of the varsity soccer team where we won ROPSAA and
                    led various initiatives through the MSA, fostering a sense of community and belonging among
                    students. Additionally, I mentored younger students in math and science through the COY program,
                    which reinforced my passion for education and collaboration.</p>
