                <h2>Short Info About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Faiz Mustansar, a passionate and dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor of Computing Honours
                    Degree at the University of Guelph. My fascination with technology began in childhood, driven by its
                    potential to transform lives. This interest evolved into a career path as I explored software development
                    and computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I engage with the tech community through open-source projects, hackathons, and
                    tech blogging. I'm committed to mentoring in coding boot camps, helping newcomers take their first steps
                    in programming.

                <h2>Current Education</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey in education is a mix of personal and professional growth. It started at XYZ High School, graduating
                    with honors in Mathematics and Computer Science. This foundation in analytical thinking paved my way to the
                    University of Guelph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now in my third year, I've balanced rigorous coursework with practical projects, maintaining Dean's List status
                    and contributing to a research project focused on data algorithms. Real-world tech internships have enriched
                    my experience, underscoring the importance of teamwork, communication, and effective time management.
