                    Hey there! My name is Faiz Mustansar. I'm studying for a Bachelor's degree in Computing with a focus
                    on Computer Science at the University of Guelph. I've been fascinated by computers and technology
                    since I was in 10th grade. That's when I first started learning about computer science. It amazed me
                    how much we can do with computers and how they can change our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My school journey has been full of learning and growing, both personally and academically. I went to
                    Harold M. Brathwaite Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario, where I graduated with a diploma. After
                    that, I decided to go to the University of Guelph to dive deeper into Computer Science. I believe
                    it's the best place for me to learn more about my passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I'm almost done with my first year at university. It's been a busy time, trying to keep up with
                    my studies, doing projects on my own, and making sure I stay on the Dean's List. On top of that, I
                    love playing sports and joining clubs. It helps me take a break from studying and do something fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year, I've tried to do a bit of everything. I've spent a lot of time studying and working on my
                    computer skills. But I also made sure to play my favorite sports like soccer and badminton and be a
                    part of different student groups. It's been a great way to meet new friends and learn new things
                    outside of my courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to see what the next years of university will bring. I want to keep learning more about
                    computer science, work on more interesting projects, and maybe even help teach others what I've
                    learned. It's going to be a lot of hard work, but I can't wait to see where it all leads.
